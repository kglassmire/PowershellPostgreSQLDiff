# PowershellPostgreSQLDiff
Repository containing powershell script and settings file I use for PostgreSQL comparisons.

The results of the script can be seen in the Migrations repository. The update file is created at the end.

The requirements to run this are to:
* Have PostgreSQL installed somewhere on your system
* Have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system to run APGDiff and added to the global PATH variable
* Have APGDiff available in a folder somewhere
* Seemingly my remote credentials don't want to work unless I run this as an admin or right-click and say "Run with Powershell" -- looking into that...
